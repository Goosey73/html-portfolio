<h3>Princess Mononoke</h3>
<p>This movie was my first one and I love it. It shows humans' nature as it struggles with nature itself.</p>

<h3>Porco Rosso</h3>
<p>A man cursed with being a pig struggles through daily life and love.</p>

<h3>The Boy and the Herron</h3>
<p>A depiction of Miyazaki's life and the meaning of death.</p>
